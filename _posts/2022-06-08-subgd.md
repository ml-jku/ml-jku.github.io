title: "Few-Shot Learning by Dimensionality Reduction in Gradient Space"
description: SubGD is a few-shot learning method that restricts fine-tuning to a low-dimensional parameter subspace. This reduces model complexity and increases sample efficiency. SubGD identifies the subspace through the most important update directions during fine-tuning on training tasks.
