title: "GyroSwin: 5D Surrogates for Gyrokinetic Plasma Turbulence Simulations"
description: "We develop a 5D neural surrogate model, called GyroSwin, for nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations of plasma turbulence. GyroSwin is scalable, efficient and physically verifiable, paving the way towards deployment of neural surrogates for plasma turbulence simulations."
