title: "Hopfield Networks is All You Need"
description: We introduce a new energy function and a corresponding new update rule which is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum of the energy function. Surprisingly, the new update rule is the attention mechanism of transformer networks introduced in Attention Is All You Need. We use these new insights to analyze transformer/attention models in the paper.
