title: "CLOOB: Modern Hopfield Networks with InfoLOOB Outperform CLIP"
description: CLOOB (Contrastive Leave One Out Boost) is a novel self-supervised learning method, where modern Hopfield networks boost contrastive learning using upper bounds on the mutual information like InfoLOOB. CLOOB consistently outperforms CLIP at zero-shot transfer learning across different architectures and datasets.
