title: "CHEF: Cross Domain Hebbian Ensemble Few-Shot Learning"
description: Few-shot learning aims at learning from few examples, often by using already acquired knowledge and, therefore, enabling models to quickly adapt to new data. The reason for observing new data is a domain shift, that is, a change of the input-target distribution. While most few-shot learning methods can cope with a small domain shift, larger changes in the data distribution, however, are still challenging. CHEF (Cross-domain Hebbian Ensemble Few-shot learning) is a few-shot learning method, that is specifically designed to overcome the problems arising from domain shifts.
