title: "A Dataset Perspective on Offline Reinforcement Learning"
description: We investigate how the characteristics of the dataset influence Offline RL algorithms. Towards that end, we introduce measures that capture how explorative or exploitative a policy is. We found, that popular algorithms in Offline RL are strongly influenced by the characteristics of the dataset and that the average performance across different datasets might not be enough for a fair comparison.
