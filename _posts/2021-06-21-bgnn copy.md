title: "Boundary Graph Neural Networks for 3D Simulations"
description: Boundary Graph Neural Networks (BGNNs) extend traditional GNNs, such that the networks are capable of learning particle - wall interactions by dynamically inserting (virtual particle) nodes, if a particle is near a wall. BGNNs have learned to accurately reproduce 3D granular flows over hundreds of thousands of simulation timesteps, and most notably particles completely stay within the geometric objects without using handcrafted conditions or restrictions.
