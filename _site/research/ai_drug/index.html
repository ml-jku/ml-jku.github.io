    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods have been shown to be able to design new molecules and to accurately foresee their role in the human body. New drugs will be safer and more effective than they have ever been. Researchers of JKU have won the Tox21 Data Challenge demonstrating that neural AIs can find toxic effects. <a href="https://jku.at/en/institute-for-machine-learning/about-us/team/assist-prof-mag-dr-guenter-klambauer/">GÃ¼nter Klambauer</a> leads an <a href="https://ncats.nih.gov/news/releases/2015/tox21-challenge-2014-winners">award-winning</a> team of scientists developing AIs that design, improve and assess new drugs. Several AI-generated drugs are currently tested for their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2.</p>

    <div class="abstract hidden">
      <p>There has been a wave of generative models for molecules triggered by advances in the field of Deep Learning. These generative models are often used to optimize chemical compounds towards particular properties or a desired biological activity. The evaluation of generative models remains challenging and suggested performance metrics or scoring functions often do not cover all relevant aspects of drug design projects. In this work, we highlight some unintended failure modes in molecular generation and optimization and how these evade detection by current performance metrics.</p>

      <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is undergoing a revolution thanks to the breakthroughs of machine learning algorithms in computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing and generative modelling. Recent works on publicly available pharmaceutical data showed that AI methods are highly promising for Drug Target prediction. However, the quality of public data might be different than that of industry data due to different labs reporting measurements, different measurement techniques, fewer samples and less diverse and specialized assays. As part of a European funded project (ExCAPE), that brought together expertise from pharmaceutical industry, machine learning, and high-performance computing, we investigated how well machine learning models obtained from public data can be transferred to internal pharmaceutical industry data. Our results show that machine learning models trained on public data can indeed maintain their predictive power to a large degree when applied to industry data. Moreover, we observed that deep learning derived machine learning models outperformed comparable models, which were trained by other machine learning algorithms, when applied to internal pharmaceutical company datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study evaluating the potential of machine learning and especially deep learning directly at the level of industry-scale settings and moreover investigating the transferability of publicly learned target prediction models towards industrial bioactivity prediction pipelines.</p>

      <p>It takes about a decade to develop a new drug by a process in which a large number of decisions have to be made. Those decisions are critical for the success or failure of a multi-million dollar drug discovery project, which could save many lives or increase life quality. Decisions in early phases of drug discovery, such as the selection of certain series of chemical compounds, are particularly impactful on the success rate. Machine learning models are increasingly used to inform the decision making process by predicting desired effects, undesired effects, such as toxicity, molecular properties, or which wet-lab test to perform next. Thus, accurately quantifying the uncertainties of the modelsâ outputs is critical, for example, in order to calculate expected utilities, to estimate the risk and the potential gain. In this work, we review, assess and compare recent uncertainty estimation methods with respect to their use in drug discovery projects. We test both, which methods give well calibrated prediction and which ones perform well at misclassification detection. For the latter, we find the entropy of the predictive distribution performs best. Finally, we discuss the problem of defining out-of-distribution samples for prediction tasks on chemical compounds.</p>

      <p>Without any means of interpretation, neural networks that predict molecular properties and bioactivities are merely black boxes. We will unravel these black boxes and will demonstrate approaches to understand the learned representations which are hidden inside these models. We show how single neurons can be interpreted as classifiers which determine the presence or absence of pharmacophore- or toxicophore-like structures, thereby generating new insights and relevant knowledge for chemistry, pharmacology and biochemistry. We further discuss how these novel pharmacophores/toxicophores can be determined from the network by identifying the most relevant components of a compound for the prediction of the network. Additionally, we propose a method which can be used to extract new pharmacophores from a model and will show that these extracted structures are consistent with literature findings. We envision that having access to such interpretable knowledge is a crucial aid in the development and design of new pharmaceutically active molecules, and helps to investigate and understand failures and successes of current methods.</p>

      <p>The effectiveness of most cancer targeted therapies is short-lived. Tumors often develop resistance that might be overcome with drug combinations. However, the number of possible combinations is vast, necessitating data-driven approaches to find optimal patient-specific treatments. Here we report AstraZenecaâs large drug combination dataset, consisting of 11,576 experiments from 910 combinations across 85 molecularly characterized cancer cell lines, and results of a DREAM Challenge to evaluate computational strategies for predicting synergistic drug pairs and biomarkers. 160 teams participated to provide a comprehensive methodological development and benchmarking. Winning methods incorporate prior knowledge of drug-target interactions. Synergy is predicted with an accuracy matching biological replicates for &gt;60% of combinations. However, 20% of drug combinations are poorly predicted by all methods. Genomic rationale for synergy predictions are identified, including ADAM17 inhibitor antagonism when combined with PIK3CB/D inhibition contrasting to synergy when combined with other PI3K-pathway inhibitors in PIK3CA mutant cells.</p>

      <p>While drug combination therapies are a well-established concept in cancer treatment, identifying novel synergistic combinations is challenging due to the size of combinatorial space. However, computational approaches have emerged as a time- and cost-efficient way to prioritize combinations to test, based on recently available large-scale combination screening data. Recently, Deep Learning has had an impact in many research areas by achieving new state-of-the-art model performance. However, Deep Learning has not yet been applied to drug synergy prediction, which is the approach we present here, termed DeepSynergy. DeepSynergy uses chemical and genomic information as input information, a normalization strategy to account for input data heterogeneity, and conical layers to model drug synergies.DeepSynergy was compared to other machine learning methods such as Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines and Elastic Nets on the largest publicly available synergy dataset with respect to mean squared error. DeepSynergy significantly outperformed the other methods with an improvement of 7.2% over the second best method at the prediction of novel drug combinations within the space of explored drugs and cell lines. At this task, the mean Pearson correlation coefficient between the measured and the predicted values of DeepSynergy was 0.73. Applying DeepSynergy for classification of these novel drug combinations resulted in a high predictive performance of an AUC of 0.90. Furthermore, we found that all compared methods exhibit low predictive performance when extrapolating to unexplored drugs or cell lines, which we suggest is due to limitations in the size and diversity of the dataset. We envision that DeepSynergy could be a valuable tool for selecting novel synergistic drug combinations.DeepSynergy is available via www.bioinf.jku.at/software/DeepSynergy.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.</p>

      <p>Deep learning is currently the most successful machine learning technique in a wide range of application areas and has recently been applied successfully in drug discovery research to predict potential drug targets and to screen for active molecules. However, due to (1) the lack of large-scale studies, (2) the compound series bias that is characteristic of drug discovery datasets and (3) the hyperparameter selection bias that comes with the high number of potential deep learning architectures, it remains unclear whether deep learning can indeed outperform existing computational methods in drug discovery tasks. We therefore assessed the performance of several deep learning methods on a large-scale drug discovery dataset and compared the results with those of other machine learning and target prediction methods. To avoid potential biases from hyperparameter selection or compound series, we used a nested cluster-cross-validation strategy. We found (1) that deep learning methods significantly outperform all competing methods and (2) that the predictive performance of deep learning is in many cases comparable to that of tests performed in wet labs (i.e., in vitro assays).</p>

      <p>The new wave of successful generative models in machine learning has increased the interest in deep learning driven de novo drug design. However, method comparison is difficult because of various flaws of the currently employed evaluation metrics. We propose an evaluation metric for generative models called FrÃ©chet ChemNet distance (FCD). The advantage of the FCD over previous metrics is that it can detect whether generated molecules are diverse and have similar chemical and biological properties as real molecules.</p>

      <p>Biclustering has become a major tool for analyzing large datasets given as matrix of samples times features and has been successfully applied in life sciences and e-commerce for drug design and recommender systems, respectively. Factor Analysis for Bicluster Acquisition (FABIA), one of the most successful biclustering methods, is a generative model that represents each bicluster by two sparse membership vectors: one for the samples and one for the features. However, FABIA is restricted to about 20 code units because of the high computational complexity of computing the posterior. Furthermore, code units are sometimes insufficiently decorrelated and sample membership is difficult to determine. We propose to use the recently introduced unsupervised Deep Learning approach Rectified Factor Networks (RFNs) to overcome the drawbacks of existing biclustering methods. RFNs efficiently construct very sparse, non-linear, high-dimensional representations of the input via their posterior means. RFN learning is a generalized alternating minimization algorithm based on the posterior regularization method which enforces non-negative and normalized posterior means. Each code unit represents a bicluster, where samples for which the code unit is active belong to the bicluster and features that have activating weights to the code unit belong to the bicluster.On 400 benchmark datasets and on three gene expression datasets with known clusters, RFN outperformed 13 other biclustering methods including FABIA. On data of the 1000 Genomes Project, RFN could identify DNA segments which indicate, that interbreeding with other hominins starting already before ancestors of modern humans left Africa.https://github.com/bioinf-jku/librfn</p>

      <p>Targeted next-generation-sequencing (NGS) panels have largely replaced Sanger sequencing in clinical diagnostics. They allow for the detection of copy-number variations (CNVs) in addition to single-nucleotide variants and small insertions/deletions. However, existing computational CNV detection methods have shortcomings regarding accuracy, quality control (QC), incidental findings, and user-friendliness. We developed panelcn.MOPS, a novel pipeline for detecting CNVs in targeted NGS panel data. Using data from 180 samples, we compared panelcn.MOPS with five state-of-the-art methods. With panelcn.MOPS leading the field, most methods achieved comparably high accuracy. panelcn.MOPS reliably detected CNVs ranging in size from part of a region of interest (ROI), to whole genes, which may comprise all ROIs investigated in a given sample. The latter is enabled by analyzing reads from all ROIs of the panel, but presenting results exclusively for user-selected genes, thus avoiding incidental findings. Additionally, panelcn.MOPS offers QC criteria not only for samples, but also for individual ROIs within a sample, which increases the confidence in called CNVs. panelcn.MOPS is freely available both as R package and standalone software with graphical user interface that is easy to use for clinical geneticists without any programming experience. panelcn.MOPS combines high sensitivity and specificity with user-friendliness rendering it highly suitable for routine clinical diagnostics.</p>
