Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods have been shown to be able to design new molecules and to accurately foresee their role in the human body. New drugs will be safer and more effective than they have ever been. Researchers of JKU have won the Tox21 Data Challenge demonstrating that neural AIs can find toxic effects. [GÃ¼nter Klambauer](https://jku.at/en/institute-for-machine-learning/about-us/team/assist-prof-mag-dr-guenter-klambauer/) leads an [award-winning](https://ncats.nih.gov/news/releases/2015/tox21-challenge-2014-winners) team of scientists developing AIs that design, improve and assess new drugs. Several AI-generated drugs are currently tested for their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2.
