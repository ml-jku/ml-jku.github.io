<p>
 A new wave of neural artificial intelligence is rapidly changing medicine and healthcare. The changes affect everyone from clinicians, predominantly via rapid, accurate image interpretation, over health systems, by improving workflow and the potential for reducing medical errors, and also patients, by enabling them to get individualised therapies to promote health. </p>


 [Theresa Roland](https://jku.at/en/institute-for-machine-learning/about-us/team/dipl-ing-dr-theresa-roland/) leads the healthcare and medicine group, which optimizes the [intensive care supply with AIs](https://jku.at/en/institute-for-machine-learning/blog/mc3/) and further raises the quality of patient care. Together with a prostheses manufacturer the research team has improved the robustness of active [hand prostheses](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Insulated-EMG-Sensing-for-Myoelectric-Prostheses-Control). The team of scientists has developed [AIs for medical images](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryl5khRcKm) that outperform human experts and make them understandable for [practitioners](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-28954-6).

  Currently we are investigating the potential of machine learning for predicting Covid-19 from blood laboratories.
